## Phase 0.1: Large Data Handling Strategy (2025-10-08)

### Research & Design
- ✅ Reviewed Snowflake MCP server's output handling approach
- ✅ Analyzed token estimation strategies
- ✅ Researched FRED API data size limits (100K observations, 120 req/min)
- ✅ Designed project-based storage structure

### Architecture Decisions
- ✅ **Adopted Snowflake MCP pattern**: Smart output handling with token estimation
- ✅ **Storage Strategy**: Project-based directories via `MCP_CLIENT_ROOT`
- ✅ **Output Modes**: `auto`, `screen`, `file` with intelligent routing
- ✅ **File Formats**: CSV and JSON with streaming support
- ✅ **Security**: Path validation to prevent server directory pollution
- ✅ **Token Limits**: Claude Sonnet (200K, safe: 140K), GPT-4 (100K, safe: 70K), Gemini (1M, safe: 700K)

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Added "Large Data Handling Strategy" section to `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- ✅ Updated project structure with `utils/` directory
- ✅ Added environment variables for output configuration
- ✅ Created Phase 3 in `TODO.md` for large data utilities
- ✅ Updated tool implementation tasks with output handling
- ✅ Added testing tasks for output handling
- ✅ Updated dependencies list with token counting libraries
- ✅ Added large dataset guidance to `FRED_API_REFERENCE.md`
- ✅ Documented rate limits (120 req/min confirmed)

### Key Features Planned
- Token estimation before returning results
- Automatic file vs screen decision
- Streaming large datasets to CSV/JSON files
- Project-organized storage: `{MCP_CLIENT_ROOT}/fred-data/{project}/`
- Filename auto-generation with customizable patterns
- Security validation to prevent directory traversal
- Progress feedback for large operations

### Impact on Implementation
- Added new Phase 3 for utilities (before tool implementation)
- All tools will support `output`, `format`, `project`, `filename` parameters
- Series and Maps tools marked as CRITICAL for large data handling
- Test coverage expanded to include output handling scenarios

---

## Phase 0.2: Architecture Refinements (2025-10-08)

### User Feedback Integration
- ✅ Changed from `MCP_CLIENT_ROOT` to **`FRED_STORAGE_DIR`** for clarity
- ✅ Made storage directory **user-configurable** (not MCP server root)
- ✅ Added Claude Desktop configuration with two key fields:
  - `FRED_API_KEY` (required)
  - `FRED_STORAGE_DIR` (optional, defaults to `./fred-data`)
- ✅ Researched tiktoken library (lightweight: ~2.7 MB installed)
- ✅ Decided to **include tiktoken** for accurate token counting

### JSON to CSV Conversion Strategy
- ✅ **Problem identified**: FRED API returns JSON/XML, not CSV
- ✅ **Solution**: Implement JSON to CSV converter as convenience layer
- ✅ **Rationale**: Standardize output format across MCP servers
  - Snowflake MCP returns CSV
  - FRED MCP should also return CSV (via conversion)
  - Common format for data analysis workflows
- ✅ Designed `JSONToCSVConverter` utility
- ✅ Added conversion tasks to Phase 3 in TODO.md

### Configuration Improvements
- ✅ Updated all documentation to use `FRED_STORAGE_DIR`
- ✅ Added minimal, standard, and advanced Claude Desktop config examples
- ✅ Documented default behavior: `./fred-data` if not specified
- ✅ Updated `.env` file examples

### Token Estimation with tiktoken
- ✅ Confirmed tiktoken is lightweight enough to include
- ✅ Updated architecture to use tiktoken for all token counting
- ✅ Added encoding support for Claude (cl100k_base approximation)
- ✅ Added encoding support for GPT-4 (cl100k_base)
- ✅ Updated dependencies list

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md`:
  - Replaced `MCP_CLIENT_ROOT` with `FRED_STORAGE_DIR`
  - Added JSON to CSV conversion section
  - Added tiktoken integration details
  - Updated all configuration examples
- ✅ Updated `TODO.md`:
  - Added JSON to CSV conversion tasks (9 new tasks)
  - Updated token estimation tasks for tiktoken
  - Updated path resolution for configurable directory
  - Added testing tasks for JSON to CSV
- ✅ Updated project structure to include `json_to_csv.py`

### Key Decisions
1. **Storage Directory**: User-configurable, any local filesystem path
2. **tiktoken**: Include for accurate token counting (~2.7 MB acceptable)
3. **JSON to CSV**: Provide convenience conversion for standardized output
4. **Default Format**: CSV (converted from JSON) for compatibility

---

## Phase 0.3: Async Job Management System (2025-10-08)

### Problem Identification
- ✅ User identified critical gap: No async job handling for large datasets
- ✅ FRED data can be very large (100K observations, shape files)
- ✅ Synchronous processing would block AI agent
- ✅ Need status checking capability like Snowflake MCP server

### Async Job System Design
- ✅ **Job ID Generation**: UUID-based identifiers
- ✅ **Job Lifecycle**: accepted → processing → completed/failed
- ✅ **Status Tracking**: Progress, elapsed time, estimated completion
- ✅ **Job Storage**: In-memory tracking (Redis for production)
- ✅ **Job Retention**: 24 hours configurable via `FRED_JOB_RETENTION_HOURS`

### Job Status Responses Designed
- ✅ **Immediate Response**: Returns job_id when large dataset detected
- ✅ **In Progress**: Shows rows_fetched, percent_complete, elapsed_seconds
- ✅ **Completed**: Returns file_path, rows_written, file_size
- ✅ **Failed**: Includes error code, retry count, next retry time

### New MCP Tools
- ✅ `fred_job_status` - Check status of background job (REQUIRED)
- ✅ `fred_job_list` - List recent jobs (OPTIONAL)
- ✅ `fred_job_cancel` - Cancel running job (OPTIONAL)

### Architecture Updates
- ✅ Added async job management section to ARCHITECTURE.md
- ✅ Designed job lifecycle and status responses
- ✅ Added thresholds: >10K rows or >10 seconds = async
- ✅ Added background worker architecture
- ✅ Added retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limits

### TODO.md Updates
- ✅ Added Phase 3 async job management tasks (35+ new tasks):
  - Job manager implementation
  - Background worker with asyncio task queue
  - Job retry logic and rate limit handling
  - Progress tracking and callbacks
  - Job cleanup and retention
- ✅ Added job management tool implementation tasks
- ✅ Added async job testing tasks (9 new test cases)

### Project Structure Updates
- ✅ Added `utils/job_manager.py` - Job tracking and lifecycle
- ✅ Added `utils/background_worker.py` - Background task processing
- ✅ Added `tools/job_status.py` - Status checking tool
- ✅ Added optional tools: `job_list.py`, `job_cancel.py`

### Key Decisions
1. **When to use async**: > 10K rows OR estimated time > 10 seconds
2. **Job storage**: In-memory (simple), Redis optional for production
3. **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff for rate limits (120 req/min)
4. **Job retention**: 24 hours default, configurable

### User Experience Flow
1. AI requests large dataset (e.g., 75K observations)
2. Server estimates size, creates job, returns job_id immediately
3. AI tells user: "Processing in background, job ID: fred-job-..."
4. User can ask: "Is it ready?" → AI checks status
5. When complete: AI gets file path for analysis

## Phase 0.4: Conservative Token Limits + Project Management (2025-10-08)

### User Feedback Integration
- ✅ User pointed out token estimation may be too aggressive
- ✅ Context window already partially consumed by:
  - Chat history with user
  - Multiple MCP server responses
  - System prompts and tool definitions
- ✅ User requested project management helper functions
- ✅ Need tools to scan FRED_STORAGE_DIR and list existing projects

### Conservative Token Limits
- ✅ **Changed safe thresholds from 70% to 25% of total context**
- ✅ **Claude Sonnet**: 50K safe limit (was 140K)
- ✅ **GPT-4**: 25K safe limit (was 70K)
- ✅ **Gemini Pro**: 250K safe limit (was 700K)
- ✅ Added `FRED_SAFE_TOKEN_LIMIT` configuration option
- ✅ Added `FRED_ASSUME_CONTEXT_USED` configuration (default: 0.75)
- ✅ Philosophy: "Err on the side of saving to file more often"

### Project Management Tools Designed
- ✅ **fred_project_list** - List all projects in storage directory
  - Scans FRED_STORAGE_DIR for existing projects
  - Returns metadata: file count, size, dates
  - Helps users discover existing projects
- ✅ **fred_project_create** - Create new project directory
  - Validates project name (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)
  - Creates subdirectories: series, maps, releases, categories, sources, tags
  - Creates .project.json metadata file
- ✅ **fred_project_files** - List files in a project
  - Filter by subdirectory (series, maps, etc.)
  - Sort by name, size, modified date
  - Shows file metadata: size, rows, format, dates

### Project Directory Structure
- ✅ Automatic subdirectory creation on project creation
- ✅ Metadata tracking via .project.json
- ✅ Organization: `{FRED_STORAGE_DIR}/{project-name}/{type}/`

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md`:
  - Added conservative token limits section with rationale
  - Added project management tools section
  - Added project workflow examples
  - Updated tool tables to include 3 new tools
  - Updated project structure with new tool files
- ✅ Updated `TODO.md`:
  - Added 7 token estimation tasks (conservative limits)
  - Added 18 project management tasks (implementation + testing)
  - Total new tasks: 25

### Key Decisions
1. **Token Limits**: Assume 75% of context already used (was 30%)
2. **Safe Thresholds**: 25% of total capacity (was 70%)
3. **Project Tools**: All 3 marked as required (not optional)
4. **User Experience**: AI proactively asks about project selection
5. **Simplicity**: No server-side analysis, just data retrieval

### User Quote
> "I think that should probably come from Fred-Data.functions, so that we can scan that directory, know what projects exist, and then allow the user to determine if they want to use an existing project or create a new one."
